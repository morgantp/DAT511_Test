						Thanks to the advances in modern technology, specifically smartphones and tablets, the amount of private information 
						people are sharing online is growing and with it the threats and dangers to our data is growing at a commensurate rate. 
						Medical history and location data, is incredibly private information but now we share it without thinking about the 
						possible ramifications if the information got in the hands of someone with malicious intent. <i>Facebook</i> is a great 
						example of this; it is filled with third party apps and quizzes that in most cases ask for permission to access parts 
						of your profile, yet no one stops to think why it needs this data. In an episode of the popular dystopian science 
						fiction show <i>Black Mirror</i> called <i>Be Right Back</i> a woman's partner dies in a car accident. She starts 
						talking to an artificial intelligence made using her partner's internet presence to be able to accurately represent 
						his personality. This meant she could talk to a computer who would respond how he would when he was alive. This is 
						a terrifying idea, but isn’t too far off the realm of possibility as our social lives become more and more digital, 
						we put more of our personalities online. I challenge you to think about every message, email, snap, whatsapp you have 
						sent in the last 24 hours. If someone was to get all of these messages what information could they learn? Your sense 
						of humour, your favourite food, movie, game, or even more sensitive information; bank details, family names or your 
						home address. While nearly all social medias encrypt your messages it brings back what I mentioned earlier; permission. 
						If a website can trick you into allowing access to your most personal data these “scam artists” would have successfully 
						hacked their way into your life. Now these sort of data hacks are easily stopped by clearing an app's permissions or 
						changing your password, however a shockingly large amount of people don’t fully understand the technology they use 
						everyday and it is this naivety that hackers rely on in order to get sensitive information. Now data is an issue which 
						is consistently brought up in government most notably when the founder of <i>Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg</i> went to the 
						United States Congress to answer claims that <i>Facebook</i> had been mismanaging it’s user’s data. In these 
						investigations <i>Zuckerberg</i> admitted that all user information exists in <i>Facebook’s</i> databases but they 
						would never access or share this information as it would be a huge breach of someone’s privacy. However, we’re 
						hearing more and more news stories of a large site being victim to a cyber attack where millions of user’s data 
						can be compromised. If this was to happen to a platform as large as <i>Facebook</i> the fallout could be catastrophic. 
						During this current crisis people are more and more controlled by fear. In Phone Invasion I hope to show how someone 
						could craft a narrative to get as much data from you as possible.

						In this test we will ask you some questions regarding your health and we will do some tests that will require access to

						artificial intelligence that will look at all your data and decide whether you are safe from the coronavirus. In order 
						to get the most accurate results please allow access to all systems when asked. If you do not, this test may give you an 
						incorrect result which may result in you thinking you’re safe when you are in fact at risk.

							Coronavirus is a respiratory disease, which can be fatal to people with issues with breathing. This test will ask

							your voice to gather information on the quality of your breathing. The phrase must be longer than a single word so 
							we highly recommend saying something like your full name and date of birth as that in all cases will ensure the 
							programme has enough data to work with. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION YOUR RESULTS MAY BE INCORRECT!
